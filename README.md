# Order:
Some packs require to be in a specific order to work properly together.

Going by the ordering within the Minecraft resource pack menu (top to bottom priority):
- Better Leaves
- Reimagined FA Patch (Fresh Animations)
- Fresh Animations
- Reimagined Fixed
- Reimagined
- Eating Animations base
    - __Due to the custom Eating Animations handling, this is one required for them to show properly__ (built-in mod resources are bugged in the current version)

Every other pack is optional and can be anywhere in the order (but preferably above the ones listed above)

*NOTE: If the resource pack reload takes a long time, it's probably Visual Enchantments*
